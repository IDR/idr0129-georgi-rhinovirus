Study Description	Viral infectious diseases span a myriad of maladies, including immunosuppression, cancer, organ failure and, if lacking effective treatment, even death. While numerous targeted antiviral therapies have been developed over the past century, many viral diseases still lack effective antivirals to date. Revisiting compounds approved for other applications offers accelerated development, and automated screening and data processing boost the feasibility of the re-purposing approach. Here, we extended our high-content image-based platform  on three human viruses differing in genome composition, envelope state, and tropism, namely human rhinovirus (RV), Human rhinovirus (IAV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Among the 1,280 mainly FDA-approved compounds, we identified potent inhibitors and even enhancers of multi-round infection propagation in vitro. The most potent inhibitors were 5-azacytidin against RV-A16, clotrimazole against IAV-WSN, and raltitrexed against HSV-1. Clobetasol was found to significantly enhance HSV-1 infection. Remarkably, Aminacrine, a topical antiseptic, inhibited all three viruses tested. Follow-up experiments of the highest-scoring modulators confirmed their performance.

Protocol Description	HeLa Ohio cells were maintained in full medium: high glucose DMEM containing 7.5% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin streptomycin and subcultured following PBS washing and trypsinisation  weekly. Cell cultures were grown at standard conditions (33.5°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) and passage number limited to 20.	The screening was performed in four independent biological replicates on 384-well plates. Wet-lab liquid handling was performed using a Matrix WellMate dispenser and Matrix WellMate tubing cartridges. Prior to usage, tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved ddH2O followed by 125 ml autoclaved PBS. Pre-spotted compound plates were thawed at room temperature for 30 min, briefly centrifuged before compounds were dissolved in 10 μl/ well PBS. 6,000 HeLa Ohio cells/ well in 60 μl full medium were seeded onto the compounds using standard bore tubing cartridges. Following cell adhesion over night, the cells were inoculated with 30 PFU per well of RV-A16 in 10 μl full media using small bore tubing cartridges. Final compound concentration was 1.25 μM at 0.0125% DMSO. Infection was allowed to progress over multiple infection rounds for 48 h giving rise to foci of infected cells originating from a single first round infected cell termed plaque. Cells were fixed for 1 h at RT by addition of 26.6 μL 16% PFA and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS using standard bore tubing cartridges. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS before PBS supplemented with 0.02% N3 was added and plates were sealed for long-term storage at 4°C. 	The Prestwick Chemical Library was selected because it contains 1,280 commercially available off-patent FDA-approved small molecules from a variety of pharmaceutical classes. Identified anti-adenoviral hits are likely repurposable, since toxicity and bioavailability has been assessed in clinical trials.	Cells were fixed and nuclei stained with Hoechst.  Infected wells did not have to be stained since RV-A16-GFP expressed GFP as infection marker. Plates were epifluorescently imaged using an IXM-C (Molecular Devices) and an IN Cell 2200 (GE Healthcare). The infection phenotype for each well was quantified by Plaque2.0 (Yakimovich et al. 2015) via five read-outs: number of nuclei, number of infected nuclei, the ratio between infected and total nuclei referred to as infection index, number of multi-round infection foci termed plaques (plaque forming units, pfu) and the integrated viral transgenic GFP intensity. Plaque2.0 parameters were optimized independently for the data acquired at the respective institution. 	Hits were filtered for maximal antiviral effect (outside of 3 SD of negative control) and minimal toxicity (inside of 2 SD of negative control and additional non-infected assays).

Quality Control Description	The wet-lab pipeline was optimized regarding liquid handling, cell seeding, virus inoculum, positive and negative control, time line, imaging and image analysis to ensure high assay stability and reproducibility. All compounds, especially media and supplements, the BSA for tubing saturation, PFA- and Hoechst-supplemented fixative were prepared as large batch from a single LOT and stored as single-use aliquots. Assay stability with respect to cell and infection phenotype was tested prior to Z'plates and screening on pre-plates. Assay quality was determined by 2 Z' plates. Z' plates and screening plates were imaged on different microscopes and analysed by two independent research teams.

Quality Control Description	The wet-lab pipeline was optimized regarding liquid handling, cell seeding, virus inoculum, positive and negative control, time line, imaging and image analysis to ensure high assay stability and reproducibility. All compounds, especially media and supplements, the BSA for tubing saturation, PFA- and Hoechst-supplemented fixative were prepared as large batch from a single LOT and stored as single-use aliquots. Assay stability with respect to cell and infection phenotype was tested prior to Z'plates and screening on pre-plates. Assay quality was determined by 2 Z' plates. Z' plates and screening plates were imaged on different microscopes and analysed by two independent research teams.

Protocol Description	HeLa Ohio cells were maintained in full medium: high glucose DMEM containing 7.5% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin streptomycin and subcultured following PBS washing and trypsinisation  weekly. Cell cultures were grown at standard conditions (33.5°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) and passage number limited to 20.	The screening was performed in four independent biological replicates on 384-well plates. Wet-lab liquid handling was performed using a Matrix WellMate dispenser and Matrix WellMate tubing cartridges. Prior to usage, tubings were rinsed with 125 ml autoclaved ddH2O followed by 125 ml autoclaved PBS. Pre-spotted compound plates were thawed at room temperature for 30 min, briefly centrifuged before compounds were dissolved in 10 μl/ well PBS. 6,000 HeLa Ohio cells/ well in 60 μl full medium were seeded onto the compounds using standard bore tubing cartridges. Following cell adhesion over night, the cells were inoculated with 30 PFU per well of RV-A16 in 10 μl full media using small bore tubing cartridges. Final compound concentration was 1.25 μM at 0.0125% DMSO. Infection was allowed to progress over multiple infection rounds for 48 h giving rise to foci of infected cells originating from a single first round infected cell termed plaque. Cells were fixed for 1 h at RT by addition of 26.6 μL 16% PFA and 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in PBS using standard bore tubing cartridges. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS before PBS supplemented with 0.02% N3 was added and plates were sealed for long-term storage at 4°C. 	The Prestwick Chemical Library was selected because it contains 1,280 commercially available off-patent FDA-approved small molecules from a variety of pharmaceutical classes. Identified anti-adenoviral hits are likely repurposable, since toxicity and bioavailability has been assessed in clinical trials.	Cells were fixed and nuclei stained with Hoechst.  Infected wells did not have to be stained since RV-A16-GFP expressed GFP as infection marker. Plates were epifluorescently imaged using an IXM-C (Molecular Devices) and an IN Cell 2200 (GE Healthcare). The infection phenotype for each well was quantified by Plaque2.0 (Yakimovich et al. 2015) via five read-outs: number of nuclei, number of infected nuclei, the ratio between infected and total nuclei referred to as infection index, number of multi-round infection foci termed plaques (plaque forming units, pfu) and the integrated viral transgenic GFP intensity. Plaque2.0 parameters were optimized independently for the data acquired at the respective institution. 	Hits were filtered for maximal antiviral effect (outside of 3 SD of negative control) and minimal toxicity (inside of 2 SD of negative control and additional non-infected assays).
